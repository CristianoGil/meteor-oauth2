<template name="configureLoginServiceDialogForMeteorOAuth2Server">
    <p>
        Configure your Meteor server API account. Each meteor site operates differently, so there is not unified API website to goto.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you operate the resource owner (the server that holds the credentials), then add a client to the collection by
        checking out <a href="https://github.com/prime-8-consulting/meteor-oauth2/blob/master/examples/resourceServer/server/index.js">the example on this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not operate the resource owner, then you must contact the service in some way to get the keys.
    </p>

    This is the information the resource owner will need from you.
