        If you operate the AuthenticationServer, you can add a client by directly editing it's database.  There is a convience function that runs on startup which<a href="https://github.com/prime-8-consulting/meteor-oauth2/blob/master/examples/resourceServer/server/index.js"> autogenerates a client.</a>  In a production environment, this entry would be generated by an admin console or a client API Key Request Page.  If you do not operate the resource owner, then you must contact the service in some way to get the keys.

        Configure the ClientApplication by entering the ClientID in this form. Each meteor site operates differently, so there is not unified API website to goto.  The AuthenticationServer will need the following a Redirect URI:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Redirect URI: {{base_url}}_oauth/MeteorOAuth2Server
        </li>
    </ol>
</template>
